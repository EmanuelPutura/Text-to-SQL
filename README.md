# Exploring the Potential of Using Transfer Learning with Google T5 Model for Text-to-SQL Tasks
Author: **Emanuel-Vasile Putura** - Department of Computer Science, Babes-Bolyai University

> The code is inspired from a number of different sources, the main one being this [Google Colab](https://github.com/patil-suraj/exploring-T5/blob/master/t5_fine_tuning.ipynb) written by Suraj Patil.

> Besides rewritting and adapting the code for our goals, we attempted to modify the model by changing certain hyperparameters and training arguments, such as the epochs number, the batch size, the optimizer, etc. 

> This is the [Github repository](https://github.com/EmanuelPutura/Text-to-SQL) for this project. There you can find the documentation for it, a presentation poster and a short teaser video.
