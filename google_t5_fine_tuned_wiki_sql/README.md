# Exploring the Potential of Using Transfer Learning with Google T5 Model for Text-to-SQL Tasks
Author: **Emanuel-Vasile Putura** - Department of Computer Science, Babes-Bolyai University

> The code is inspired from a number of different sources, the main one being this [Google Colab](https://github.com/patil-suraj/exploring-T5/blob/master/t5_fine_tuning.ipynb) written by Suraj Patil.

> Besides rewritting and adapting the code for our goals, I attempted to modify the model by changing certain hyperparameters and training arguments, such as the epochs number, the batch size, the optimizer, etc. 

> In this repository you can also find the documentation and the presentation of the project, together with a poster created for the Computer Vision and Deep Learning course at Babe»ô-Bolyai University.
